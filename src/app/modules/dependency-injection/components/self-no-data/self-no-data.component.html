<h2>using @Optional & @Self Resolution Modifier</h2>
<p>Optional Component still works even if the injected service is null because one of the injected service is marked as '@Optional()' 
    Using @Self tells angular to look only into ElementInjector. So leafService is not provided in componenet metadata declaration so it will be null.
